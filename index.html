  Build a simple HTML profile page with the following elements (use the right HTML tags):


  an image of yourself (✅)
a header and sub-header with your name and your job title (you can put programmer now 💻) (✅)
a description of yourself (✅)
a button (✅)
a list of your social links (✅)
-->

<!--
  ids are used for unqiue elements, classes are resuable and ids are not
name classes & ids in CSS really descriptive, so you write a documentation
without writing a documentation
